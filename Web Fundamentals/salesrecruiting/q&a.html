            <h2>How long do I have to work in the summer?</h2>
            <p>It is totally up to you. The cool part about Vivint is that you are able to sell throughout the
                year and we work the whole summer. People typically start at the beginning of April and end around
                September. All you have to do is tell us your start and stop date and we'll work with you.

            <h2>What are the benefits of doing summer sales?</h2>
            <p>Summer sales provides an opportunity to learn about the root of sales: people. You get the 
                opportunity to talk to people door to door and react with them 1 on 1. This is something most sales 
                jobs won't get you and having this opportunity will put you ahead of the game compared to anyone else.
                You also get to be surrounded by people that are entrepreneur minded. The cool part is, through the networking
                opportunites given in Vivint, you'll find people interested in real estate, crypto, etc. There are tremendouns opportunites
                ahead for you.

                incentive for you to sell as hard as you can and reap the rewards from it.
