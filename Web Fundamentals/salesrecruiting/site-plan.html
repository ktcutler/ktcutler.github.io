      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How many times have you had someone in Summer Sales ask you about selling with them? Lets say they contact you on social media and you're actually
         interested but you dont want to message them personally. I create professional websites that allow you to put your personal info and be contacted by 
         someone within the company. Doing this will allow you to get more leads and also make it easier for recruits to get more info on selling for you. I talked
         to my manager on my summer sales team and he thinks this would be a good idea to do. Creating a page for summer sales would be huge in adding to the
         professionalism of the team and would increase potential opportunities for recruits. </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Those that are interested in doing summer sales and are looking for a sales team that is professional and strives for the upmost quality. Having a quality site to show this 
        will bring those that are genuinaly professional and hard working.

        As known by anyone that goes to a BYU school, summer sales is a dominating facet of the culture. There are so many companies that are trying to recruit
        in order to get as many people as possible on their teams so that they can make the most money. What makes it even more complicated is there are multiple 
        teams within a company as well on an individual campus which causes even more competition to occur. This mad dash for recruits requires companies/teams 
        to hold themselves to a higher ideal and make their team come across as professional and trustworthy. Creating a website that accomplishes this will be well 
        worth the time. People that come to the site will be interested and/or curious about summer sales. Most likely they have been asked over and over again to join 
        various sales teams and they are wanting to weigh their options. They will be drawn to the professionalism of the sight and how Vivint (company) will provide them 
        all the benefits needed to find success in the summer. If they are experienced in the culture of sales and are currently on a team, they will want to figure out what Vivint 
        has to offer and compare it to their own team. If we create the site correctly and professionally, they will most likely want to learn more and talk to an actual person which is 
        what this site is for.

      </ul>
      <h3 class="bold">What questions will my visitors expect my site to answer for them?</h3>
      <p>
        They will be expecting answers to questions like: What makes your team unique? Who are the team leads and how much do they make per summer? 
        What is the commission rate? Are you allowed to take vacations throughout the summer? Where do you choose locations to sell?
        What makes selling security/smart home better than pest or solar? Are there any special benefits for selling with Vivint? When do I get my backend?
        How much money can I make off of recruits? When can I become a team lead? How much money will I be paid in the summer for my sales?
        Visitors will want to be able to get all the necessary info to make an educated decision on why they should sell with Vivint.
        They will want to read about the team, who is on it, what Vivint has to offer etc. They will also want to get the contact info for team leads and other
        leaders to get more info. If they want to sign on immediately, they can use this site as an avenue to do so.

      <h3 class="bold">Why will my visitors come to my site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h3>
      <p>
        They will come to my site instead of another because through this site, they will see how professional Vivint is.
        This site will show to the prospective recruit that Vivint has all the opportunites, amazing leadership, and professionalism required
        to make a solid sales team. They will want to learn more because doing so will give them the opportunity to work for a company that is highly reputable 
        and will provide them great success. With our other marketing efforts via social media, this website will be the avenue where people can learn more. 
        This site will show everything that Vivint has to offer and will impress anyone that comes to it. Most sales teams don’t have a website and only recruit
        via people. Having a site will put Vivint above its competitors and will thus increase the number of recruits.
